## Description
bugs:
- server code deletes message if the user is not in the right directory.
- when in bob, if alice writes a message and attempts login using bob, the server will delete the message since the alice does not have access to bob's directory.
- work around: check if the user is in the right directory before calling messages from the server.

# Secret Agent Communication System Checklist


# Secret Agent Communication System Checklist

## General Overview
- [ ] System consists of a `Client.java` and a `Server.java` program.

## Server Program
- [ ] Named `Server.java`.
- [ ] Started with the command `java Server port`.
- [ ] Always running once started.
- [ ] Listens for incoming connections at the specified port.
- [ ] Handles one client connection at a time.
- [ ] Waits for the next request after handling the current one (server never terminates).

## Client Program
- [ ] Named `Client.java`.
- [ ] Started with the command `java Client host port userid`.
- [ ] Each agent has a unique userid (e.g., `alice`, `bob`).
- [ ] Assumes the server's userid is `server`.
- [ ] Associated with a pair of RSA public and private keys.

## RSA Keys
- [ ] Key filenames follow the pattern `<userid>.pub` or `<userid>.prv`.
- [ ] Generated by a separate program named `RSAKeyGen.java`.
- [ ] Server has its own private key and the public keys of all agents.
- [ ] Each agent has their own private key and the public key of the server.
- [ ] Agents do not have the public keys of other agents.
- [ ] Key files must be located in the same folder as the client/server program.
- [ ] Programs must not require keys that they are not supposed to have.

## Encryption and Signature
- [ ] Encryption uses RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding algorithm.
- [ ] Signature uses SHA256withRSA algorithm.
- [ ] Appropriate keys used for encryption and signature as required.

## Message Handling
- [ ] Messages encrypted with server's public key by sender.
- [ ] Server decrypts and re-encrypts messages for the recipient.
- [ ] Stored messages kept encrypted on the server.
- [ ] Hashing of userid uses MD5 with "gfhk2024:" prefix.

## Communication Protocol
- [ ] Initial server state has no messages.
- [ ] Server only holds messages in memory.
- [ ] Client sends hashed userid to server.
- [ ] Server informs client of message count.
- [ ] Messages signed by server before sending to client.
- [ ] Client verifies signature and decrypts messages.
- [ ] Client prompts for message sending.
- [ ] Encrypted and signed messages sent to server.
- [ ] Server verifies signature and processes messages.

## Program Outputs
- [ ] Server prints hashed userid, message sender, and recipient info.
- [ ] Server reports signature verification and decryption failures.
- [ ] Example outputs provided for client and server programs.

## Additional Notes
- [ ] No new keys are created or distributed by the client or server programs.
- [ ] Keys are obtained via a separate, unspecified mechanism before execution.
- [ ] No key information is hardcoded in the client or server programs.
- [ ] Check that the right error messages are being printed out.
